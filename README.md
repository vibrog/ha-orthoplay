# OD-11 loudspeaker component for Home Assistant

A custom component for local control of the
[OD-11 wireless speaker from Teenage Engineering][od11]
via its WebSocket interface.

## How it works

The OD-11 exposes a WebSocket server on port 8081. This integration
maintains a persistent connection to the speaker, sends commands, and
listens for state updates pushed by the speaker in real time.

On connection, the integration performs the Orthoplay handshake
(`global_join`/`group_join`) to receive the current speaker state,
including volume, input source, and playback status.

The speaker can be discovered automatically on the local network with
[Zeroconf][] using DNS-SD over mDNS (`_http._tcp`/`_airplay._tcp`),
or added manually by IP address.

### Features

- The list of **sources** are populated dynamically.
- The entity icon changes to reflect the active input source.
- **Playback controls** are shown or hidden dynamically based on
  the capabilities reported by the speaker for each source.
- The **track position** updates in real time from the speaker.
- **Reconnects** automatically when speaker wakes from standby.

### Limitations

- **Turn on** is not supported because the OD-11 can only be woken
  by pressing the function button. The integration reconnects
  automatically once the speaker is reachable.
- **Pause** is equivalent to **stop**
  because there is no separate pause command on the OD-11.
- **Album art** is not provided by the OD-11.
- **Bluetooth next/previous**: The OD-11 does not support [AVRCP][], so
  track navigation is not available for Bluetooth sources.
- The OD-11 **playlist** functionality is no longer officially
  supported by Teenage Engineering. The **play media** action rely on
  the `playlist_add_url` command and may still work for certain URLs.
  The OD-11 used to support [Soundcloud][] and generic URLs, but
  further investigation is required to determine which sources and
  audio formats are accepted.
- **Queue insertion** (`enqueue: next`) is not supported by the
  `playlist_add_url` command, and the action will return an error.

## Installation and setup

There are 2 different methods of installing the custom component.

### HACS installation

1. Open HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**
2. Add this repository URL, category **Integration**
3. Install **OD-11 wireless loudspeaker**
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Git installation

SSH into your HA instance and clone the repository directly into your
config directory:

```bash
dir=/config/custom_components && [ -d $dir ] || mkdir -p $dir && cd $dir
git clone https://github.com/vibrog/ha-orthoplay
./ha-orthoplay/scripts/link.sh
ha core restart
```

Or clone the repository on your local machine and use the deploy script
to copy files to your HA instance.

### Setup

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**. If the speaker is on your
network, it may be discovered automatically and prompt you to
confirm. Otherwise, manually **Add Integration** and search for
**Orthoplay** to enter the IP address of your speaker manually.

Note: `od-11.local` may not resolve on all networks depending on mDNS
support and router configuration. Use Orthoplay or your routers DHCP
list to find the speaker's IP address if needed.

## Disclaimer

This integration was developed by reverse engineering the
[Orthoplay](https://www.orthoplay.com/) web application for the OD-11,
with the assistance of [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/). The WebSocket
interfaces were derived from the Orthoplay JavaScript source, and
implemented on the [Home Assistant integration structure][dev], over a
few iterations.
